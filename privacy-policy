Data Protection at a Glance</strong></p><p><strong>General Information</strong></p><p>The following notes provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website. Personal data are all data with which you can be personally identified. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy listed below this text.</p><p><strong>Data Collection on This Website</strong></p><p>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</p><p>The data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find their contact details in the &quot;Notice on the Responsible Party&quot; section of this privacy policy.</p><p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p><p>Your data is collected, firstly, by you providing it to us. This can be, for example, data that you enter into a contact form. Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website through our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or time of the page call). The collection of this data happens automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p><p><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong></p><p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the error-free provision of the website. Other data can be used to analyze your user behavior.</p><p>What rights do you have regarding your data?</p><p>You have the right to obtain information about the origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data at any time, free of charge. You also have the right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have given consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. Furthermore, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p><p>For this purpose and for further questions on the subject of data protection, you can contact us at any time.</p><p><strong>Analysis Tools and Third-Party Tools</strong></p><p>When visiting this website, your surfing behavior can be statistically evaluated. This happens mainly with so-called analysis programs. Detailed information on these analysis programs can be found in the following privacy policy.</p><p><strong>2. Hosting</strong></p><p>We host our website with Webflow. The provider is Webflow Inc,</p><p>398 11th Street, 2nd Floor San Francisco, CA 94103 </p><p>Details can be found in Webflow´s privacy policy: [Webflow Privacy Policy](<a href="https://webflow.com/legal/privacy">https://webflow.com/legal/privacy</a>).</p><p><strong>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</strong></p><p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p><p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p><p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p><p><strong>Notice Concerning the Responsible Party</strong></p><p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p><p>Fernando Tábora</p><p>Passauerstr. 35</p><p>81369 Munich</p><p>Phone: +49 17681330930</p><p>Email: hello@fernandotabora.eu</p><p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p><p><strong>Storage Duration</strong></p><p>Unless a more specific storage period is mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing ceases to apply. If you assert a legitimate deletion request or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion takes place after these reasons cease to apply.</p><p><strong>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</strong></p><p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9 (1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing also takes place on the basis of Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing additionally takes place on the basis of § 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The respective legal basis in each individual case is explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p><p><strong>Notice on Data Transfer to the USA and Other Third Countries</strong></p><p>We use tools from companies based in the USA or other data protection non-secure third countries, among others. If these tools are active, your personal data can be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that in these countries, no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you, as the data subject, being able to take legal action against this. It cannot, therefore, be ruled out that US authorities (e.g., intelligence services) process, evaluate, and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p><p><strong>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</strong></p><p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p><p><strong>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</strong></p><p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 (1) (E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 (1) GDPR).</p><p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 (2) GDPR).</p><p><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</strong></p><p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p><p><strong>Right to Data Portability</strong></p><p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only take place to the extent technically feasible.</p><p><strong>SSL or TLS Encryption</strong></p><p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p><p><strong>Information, Deletion, and Correction</strong></p><p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient,</p></div></div></section><div class="footer"><div class="global-container global-container-footer"><div class="w-layout-grid footer-links-grid"><div id="w-node-aee1ed35-8f6e-4c8e-e2f4-90f253e935b9-98861447" class="footer-social-links-container"><a href="mailto:hello@fernandotabora.eu?subject=Hi%20Fernando" class="contact-link">EMAIL</a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/taboravisuals/" target="_blank" class="contact-link">INSTAGRAM</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-t%C3%A1bora-1476b4a9/" class="contact-link">LINKEDIN</a></div><div id="w-node-f76a78dd-dae1-0f69-d007-6fb9902c1d21-98861447" class="footer-social-links-container footer-social-links-container--left"><a href="imprint" class="contact-link">Imprint</a><a href="privacy-policy" aria-current="page" class="contact-link w--current">Privacy</a><a href="general-terms-and-conditions" class="contact-link">Legal</a></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=656e2de3285e40ad4e07c5fb" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/656e2de3285e40ad4e07c5fb/js/webflow.79b022a683635b47eadcd93c421cc31b.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
